# Bhandara Buddy – Real-Time Bhandara Finder

Bhandara Buddy is a simple yet powerful web app that helps people find nearby Bhandaras (free food distribution events) in real time. It also allows individuals or organizations to share extra food, making it easier for those in need to locate and access it.
This project was built with the idea of reducing food waste while making food accessibility more convenient for everyone. I handled the front-end development, working closely with Firebase for real-time data sync and storage.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase (Realtime Database & Hosting)

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Find Bhandaras and food donation spots based on your current location.
- 📤 Submit food availability details (quantity, contact info, and coordinates).
- 📝 Request food pickup via modal forms for easy coordination.
- 📱 Fully responsive design that works smoothly on all screen sizes.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Users allow location access to find nearby food donation points.
2. Donors can submit food details using a simple form.
3. All submissions are stored in Firebase and displayed in real time.
